		<blockquote>We spent our honeymoon in the cottage in 2008 and as we approach our anniversary have just been chatting about what a wonderful time we had. The cottage was perfect and we couldn't have asked for more. Two children later, I can't remember if you have stair gates in the cottage?! Dull question but didn't have to think about these things then so probably never noticed!
		Hope you are all well and thanks again for the wonderful memories we will have forever. Ben and Jo.We spent a week at the villa in September 2011 and had an amazing time. The villa is well equipped in beautiful surroundings- the perfect place to relax and unwind. We can't wait to go back! <br>

		<blockquote>Have just arrived home from a fantastic week at La Vieille Dezie July 2011, we hired the cottage and barn and all 11 of us were not disappointed in anyway. The location and standard of accommodation and facilities were fantastic and we all agreed that we would love to come back and would recommend to friends. 
		Grant, you made us feel so welcome after such a long drive and thanks for stocking the fridges for us it was really appreciated. Oh and we were all spell bound by your fantastic Chinese omelettes’... My wife Janine misses Dougie as he was such a character especially when he was sitting at the cottage window watching us in total confusion when we decided to hold a Wii Dance party night, she sends her love to him. 
		Grant your family made us all feel so welcome and your son entertained us by playing his own game of "put the lead on the pony" instead of pin the tail on the donkey... he was so funny chatting away whilst chasing the pony around the pool and barn. 
		Please could you also pass on our thanks to the manager of the Spar who would cut us some fantastic fresh steaks for our Surf & Turfs and make fresh burgers for the BBQ, we would also like to apologise for leaving his shelves bare especially in the wine and lager isles.We spent a week at the villa in September 2011 and had an amazing time.

		<blockquote>We stayed at the villa in May 2011 and really enjoyed it. The location was great as was the pool and jacuzzi. Loads of space, well furnished and just a generally realxing place to be. 
		Highlights: Playing in the pool with the kids, watching the sun set from the jacuzzi and exploring the nearby towns and countryside.<br>
		We hope to come back at some point!<br>

		<blockquote>We stayed in this area last week and had the two villas for us. Our families are friends who did many times this type of holiday.<br>
		What my family is concerned, this was definitely a must! (the others should speak for themselves)
		Very beautiful and extensive grounds, nice pool and many terraces. The interior is very attractive. The owner is helpful and always available.<br>
		WiFi, big screen TV (but not a "tour de France" to receive!)<br>
		Animals should be not scaring to you, because they keep you company all day long.<br>

		It tastes for more ;)<br>

		Kind regards,<br>

		<blockquote>We were lucky enough to have the pool to ourselves for 3 weeks! La Viellle Dezie provides perfect peace. Since we love animals then the 3 horses, Dougie the dog, Nou Nou the cat and the busy-body chickens together with the wild life were a real bonus. We had almost continuous sunshine - all the better because the UK was mostly rainy! We will always remember the early morning jacuzzis looking out over the early morning mist over the fields and watching the sun go down as we ate supper. Grant and Christelle were very helpful and charming. It was a very memorable and special holiday.<br>

		<blockquote>We had a very good stay in the barn in July with our two young children. We had Grandparents visiting too and there was plenty of room for us all. We loved the private deck with bbq. The setting is gorgeous and very peaceful. We got lucky with a very nice family staying in the house next door, but I am not sure we would take that risk again as you see a lot of each other and of course, share the pool. 
		This place is ideal if you have a big group who can use both the house and barn. Grant and Christelle were very helpful without being intrusive and were excellent with the children. The children will never forget their pony rides on Roudoudou! <br>

		Wi Fi and a huge TV with UK channels was very good. A DVD player would have been a good addition. <br>

		Overall we had a very relaxing stay and loved being in such a good location for visiting other places in the Dordogne.<br>

		<blockquote>Wow- What a wonderful location and house! We stayed in the Barn with 3 young children and a grandpa, and it had everything you could ask for. After our long days out we could come back to the house and just relax at the pool and jacuzzi. The set up of the grounds is perfect for children- lots of green space to run around and toys to play with. The large TV was perfect for watching the World Cup, and Grant was so great to have fans for us in the hot weather. The house was super clean and had all the modern ammenities- Just can't recommend this place enough! We had a fabulous vacation- Thanks!<br>

		<blockquote>Really enjoyed our stay here despite the unpredictable weather. We stayed in the barn, which was beautiful, stacked full of period features but with the mod cons necessary to enjoy a night in if you wanted one (UK television channels should you need them, wi-fi, etc).
		The pool was great, as was the jacuzzi and it was set in a beautiful location, feeling like a retreat from the madness of back home.
		The nearest town/village is Vergt, which is about 5 or 6 miles away. You can walk it (which we did) but be prepared to walk back as the taxis don't seem to happy to stop if you attempt to wave them down - fortunately half way back the owner Grant appeared from nowhere and drove us back to the barn! With this in mind I would say it is absolutely essential that you hire a car for your stay. It will take about 40 mins to get to the barn/cottage from the airport at Bergerac (great airport, through customs in about 2 minutes) and you'll need it to travel to nearby (or not so nearby) towns and attractions.<br>

		All in all well worth a visit, thoroughly enjoyable<br>

		<blockquote>I stayed at La Vielle Dezie with my partner, some friends and their young daughter and we couldn't have imagined a more perfect week away. The cottage was beautifully furbished, very well equipped with a superb swimming pool and Jacuzzi and located in a fantasic setting. Dougie Dog was very well behaved even with young children, and it was easy to get to the local tourist attractions from here. Only 35 min drive from Bergerac airport was also very convenient. I would certainly go back again in the future.<br>

		<blockquote>Myself, partner and our two boys stayed for the first week of the new season, it was lovely, so relaxing and agreat break. Grant and Christelle were fantastic, there if we needed anything but almost like having our own home in a picturesque place. Car essential but the roads are good to drive on and the accomodation was of very high standard, would def recommend to all and hope to return but will have to be next year as it seems to get booked up fast.<br>

		<blockquote>We had a wonderful and very relaxing time! Grant and Christelle are great hosts and as per our previous stay very supportive of our children - taking them on pony rides & even teaching them about gardening.

		<blockquote>We stayed in the Villa with our 3 kids during July and had a great time. The Villa & Pool were lovely and we were delighted with the area and immediate grounds. <br>
		Grant & Christelle looked after us really well and didnt impose at all - the kids got to ride the pony and everything was perfect. <br>
		Thanks so much for a great holiday, Viv, Ade & the Girls. x<br>

		<blockquote>We really enjoyed our fortnights holiday in June at La Vieille Dezie. Grant and Christelle were very welcoming, introducing our three year old son to the joys of horses, even taking him for a walk on their pony. The surrounding area is full of interest for people of all ages, from caves to fun fairs and markets. The house provided a lovely place to return to, BBQs in the evening sat on the covered patio, watching the sun set across the fields in the late evening from inside the swimming pool, and plenty of good wine! A lovely relaxing holiday.<br>

		<blockquote>I stayed at La Vielle Dezie with my husband, my Mum and Dad and my mother in law and it was one of the best holidays we have ever had.<br>
		The gite is beautiful with a very impressive media set up full of films for rainy evenings and a barbecue coupled with gorgeous views for sunny ones. The surrounding area is packed full of villages and towns which are perfect for a day or afternoon visit. One of the highlights for me was a day visit to Beynac (an old childhood favourite for me), and we all thoroughly enjoyed an afternoon canoeing.<br>
		We enjoyed a fair few sunny afternoons drinking sparkling wine around the pool and every morning headed out to the local village for fresh croissants and baguette (a car is a must for this part of the experience).<br>
		A perfect place for anyone whose idea of heaven is barbecue followed by wine and cheese in peace and quiet watching the sun set over beautiful countryside !<br>

		<blockquote>La Vieille Dezie is a great place for relaxing! You are surrounded by peaceful country side atmosphere. The house is renovated with romantic rustic style which creates a beautiful ambience in the house. The yard is huge and all this space gives you opportunities for different kind of outdoor activities. The swimming pool is nice during the sunny days. There are many beautiful and idyllic villages nearby. It’s worth renting a car to get to know those villages. The owners are very friendly and they offer real hospitality. They gave us also many good tips about the villages, wine yards, shops etc. During our holiday we enjoyed the tranquility, serenity, beautiful views, French country side ambience and not forgetting all the dining & wining together! :)<br>
